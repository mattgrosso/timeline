            <h2>Motherboy XXX</h2>

            <hr>

            <p>
              I'm sorry, have we met? What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? Her lawyers are claiming the seal is worth $250,000. And that's not even including Buster's Swatch. In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. Hola, is Rosa still alive? No? Well this is not my day. That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears. Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog.

              No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. Oh please. They didn't sneak into this country to be your friends. Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass.            </p>

              Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard.            </p>

              Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. We need a name. Maybe 'Operation Hot Mother'. Teamocil. The Army had half a day. It's a wonderful restaurant! I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard.
